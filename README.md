##  :beginner: About
We develop innovative software solutions that solve real-world problems and improve people's lives. With a focus on applications in the areas of optical character recognition (OCT), book and image translation, text-to-speech (TSS) and speech-to-text (STT), we aim to break down barriers and facilitate access to knowledge. In doing so, we promote a culture of collaboration, creative growth and continuous improvement.

## :zap: Usage
The project has following use-cases:
- OCR for books, papers or a blackboard via picture
- Translation of texts
- Summerization of texts
- TTS
- STT
- Export in human-readable or machine-readable file-format
###  :electric_plug: Installation

 ### :cactus: Branches

 I use an agile continuous integration methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast.

1. **`stage`** is the development branch.

2. **`master`** is the production branch.

3. No other permanent branches should be created in the main repository, you can create feature branches but they should get merged with the master.

**Steps to work with feature branch**

1. To start working on a new feature, create a new branch prefixed with `feat` and followed by feature name. (ie. `feat-FEATURE-NAME`)
2. Once you are done with your changes, you can raise PR.

**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to `stage` branch.
2. Comply with the best practices and guidelines e.g. where the PR concerns visual elements it should have an image showing the effect.
3. It must pass all continuous integration checks and get positive reviews.

After this, changes will be merged.
