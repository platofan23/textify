# Kanban Boards Branch

## Purpose
This branch is dedicated to managing the project's Kanban boards. These boards help the team track tasks, monitor progress, and ensure efficient workflow throughout the development of the Textify project.

## Contents
- **Boards/**: Contains seven Kanban boards, organized as `Board 1` through `Board 7`.

## Kanban Board Structure
Each Kanban board is divided into three main columns to represent the status of tasks:

- **To Do**: Tasks that are yet to be started.
- **In Progress**: Tasks that are currently being worked on.
- **Done**: Completed tasks.

## Task Details
Each task on the Kanban board includes the following information:

| Task                                     | Description                                                        | Acceptance Criteria                                                        | Status      | Assigned To | Importance (1=Very Low, 5=Very High) |

## Directory Structure
The Kanban boards are organized within the `Boards` directory, divided into seven separate boards:

Each board corresponds to different phases or components of the project, allowing for detailed tracking and management of tasks.

## How to Use the Kanban Boards

1. **Navigate to the Boards Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Boards
    ```

2. **Select a Board:**
    - Each board is named `Board 1` through `Board 7`. Choose the appropriate board based on the project phase or component you are working on.

3. **Update Task Status:**
    - **To Do**: Add new tasks that need to be addressed.
    - **In Progress**: Move tasks here when work begins.
    - **Done**: Move tasks here once they are completed.

4. **Add or Update Tasks:**
    - Open the respective board file (e.g., `Board 1.md`) in a text editor.
    - Add new tasks following the existing table format.
    - Update the status, description, or assigned person as tasks progress.

## Guidelines
- **Clarity and Conciseness:** Ensure that all tasks are clearly described and free of ambiguity.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent formatting, terminology, and structure across all boards.
- **Priority Setting:** Assign an importance level to each task to help prioritize work effectively.
- **Regular Updates:** Keep the Kanban boards up-to-date to reflect the current status of tasks accurately.
