# ADR 007: Use Coqui-TTS with XTTSv2 for Text-to-Speech (TTS)

## Status  
Decided  

## Context  
Text-to-Speech (TTS) is a core feature of Textify, enabling the generation of high-quality speech from textual input. Several TTS frameworks and models were evaluated to determine the most suitable combination. The main requirements for the TTS system include:  

1. **Ease of Integration**: Seamless integration with the existing Python-based backend.  
2. **Multilingual Support**: High-quality speech synthesis across multiple languages.  
3. **Performance**: Efficient generation of audio files with low latency.  
4. **Quality**: Natural-sounding speech with expressive intonation.  
5. **Cost**: Minimized operational and licensing costs.  
6. **Open Source**: Preference for open-source solutions to maintain flexibility.  

### Solutions Considered  
1. **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API**  
2. **Microsoft Azure Speech Service**  
3. **Amazon Polly**  
4. **pyttsx3**  
5. **Coqui-TTS with XTTSv2**  

## Decision  
Coqui-TTS will be used as the **TTS framework**, with **XTTSv2 as the primary TTS model** for multilingual speech synthesis.

   - **Easy Python integration**, aligning with Textify's backend.  
   - **Supports multiple TTS models**, allowing for future adaptability.  
   - Enables **local deployment**, ensuring **privacy and offline capabilities**.  

3. **Open Source & Cost Efficiency**  
   - Coqui-TTS and XTTSv2 are **open-source**, avoiding vendor lock-in.  
   - **No per-usage fees**, reducing long-term operational costs.  

4. **Performance & Optimization**  
   - Coqui-TTS allows **GPU acceleration** for low-latency TTS generation.  
   - XTTSv2 is optimized for **both CPU and GPU execution**.  
   - Can be **fine-tuned for specific voices** if needed in the future.  

### Alternatives Considered  

#### 1. **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API**  
- **Pros**: High-quality voices, easy integration.  
- **Cons**: Expensive, requires cloud connectivity.  
- **Reason for Rejection**: High operational costs.  

#### 2. **Microsoft Azure Speech Service**  
- **Pros**: Advanced features, good voice quality.  
- **Cons**: Expensive, vendor lock-in.  
- **Reason for Rejection**: High licensing costs and complexity.  

#### 3. **Amazon Polly**  
- **Pros**: Affordable for low-scale usage, multiple languages.  
- **Cons**: Average voice quality, limited customization.  
- **Reason for Rejection**: Insufficient quality for natural speech synthesis.  

#### 4. **pyttsx3**  
- **Pros**: Lightweight, offline support.  
- **Cons**: Poor voice quality, slow performance.  
- **Reason for Rejection**: Does not meet quality and flexibility requirements.  

## Consequences  

### Positive  
- **High-Quality Speech**: XTTSv2 delivers **natural and expressive** speech.  
- **Cost Efficiency**: No cloud API fees, **fully open-source**.  
- **Multilingual Support**: Covers a **wide range of languages**.  
- **Offline Capability**: Can be **self-hosted without external dependencies**.  
- **Active Development**: Coqui-TTS and XTTSv2 have **ongoing support and improvements**.  

### Negative  
- **Resource Usage**: XTTSv2 requires **GPU acceleration** for optimal performance.  
- **Initial Setup Complexity**: Requires **model selection, configuration, and optimization**.  
- **Model Size**: Some pretrained models can be **large**, impacting storage requirements.  

## Implementation  

### Steps

   - Use **XTTSv2** for multilingual TTS.  
   - Test model configurations for quality vs. performance trade-offs.  

2. **Integration**  
   - Install and configure **Coqui-TTS** in the backend.  
   - Develop a **Python wrapper (`TTSSynthesizer`)** to manage TTS requests.  

3. **Optimization**  
   - Enable **GPU acceleration** for real-time synthesis.  
   - Implement **caching for frequently requested speech outputs**.  

4. **Testing**  
   - Validate speech quality across multiple languages.  
   - Conduct **load testing** to assess performance under concurrent usage.  

5. **Deployment**  
   - Deploy Coqui-TTS with XTTSv2 alongside the backend.  
   - Monitor resource usage and adjust configurations as needed.
