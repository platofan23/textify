### ADR 002: Deployment with Docker and Docker-Compose

## Status
Decided

## Context
Textify requires a consistent and scalable deployment strategy to ensure the application can run seamlessly across different environments. Docker and Docker-Compose were evaluated against alternative deployment methods (e.g., virtual machines, bare-metal servers, or Kubernetes) to address the following key factors:

- **Consistency and Isolation**: The ability to run the application consistently across development, staging, and production environments.
- **Scalability**: Support for scaling services as user demands grow.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifying the deployment process for developers and operations teams.
- **Portability**: Deploying the application on any infrastructure with minimal configuration.
- **Cost**: Minimizing infrastructure and operational costs while maintaining performance and reliability.

## Decision
Textify will use **Docker** for containerization and **Docker-Compose** for orchestration during development and deployment.

## Rationale

### **Docker**
- **Consistency**: Docker containers encapsulate all dependencies, ensuring the application behaves identically in any environment.
- **Isolation**: Containers run in isolated environments, reducing the risk of conflicts between services or dependencies.
- **Portability**: Docker images can be deployed on any infrastructure supporting Docker, enhancing portability.
- **Ease of Integration**: Docker simplifies integration with CI/CD pipelines, streamlining the deployment process.

### **Docker-Compose**
- **Service Orchestration**: Docker-Compose allows defining multi-container setups (e.g., frontend, backend, database) in a single configuration file, simplifying deployment.
- **Developer Productivity**: Developers can start the entire application stack with a single command, reducing setup complexity.
- **Environment Parity**: Docker-Compose ensures the development, staging, and production environments are consistent.
- **Scalability**: While not as advanced as Kubernetes, Docker-Compose supports scaling services by configuring replicas in the Compose file.

## Alternatives

### **Deployment Alternatives**
1. **Virtual Machines**:
   - **Pros**: Mature, well-understood technology with robust tools like Vagrant.
   - **Cons**: Heavier resource usage, slower provisioning, and lack of isolation compared to containers.

2. **Bare-Metal Deployment**:
   - **Pros**: Maximum performance, full control over hardware.
   - **Cons**: Complex setup, higher maintenance costs, no isolation.

3. **Kubernetes**:
   - **Pros**: Advanced orchestration, scalability, self-healing, service discovery.
   - **Cons**: High complexity and steep learning curve, overkill for small-to-medium-scale applications.

## Consequences

### **Positive**
- **Simplified Development**: Developers can easily spin up the application locally with Docker-Compose, ensuring environment consistency.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Services can be scaled by increasing replicas in the Compose file or switching to Kubernetes in the future.
- **Improved CI/CD**: Docker enables containerized builds, tests, and deployments in CI/CD pipelines, reducing build times and increasing reliability.
- **Cross-Platform Deployment**: Docker images ensure the application runs consistently across all platforms (e.g., cloud, on-premises).

### **Negative**
- **Initial Setup Overhead**: Developers and operations teams must familiarize themselves with Docker and Docker-Compose.
- **Performance Overhead**: Containers introduce slight overhead compared to bare-metal deployments, although this is often negligible.
- **Limited Advanced Orchestration**: Docker-Compose lacks some advanced orchestration features provided by Kubernetes, potentially requiring future migration.

## Implementation

### **Frontend and Backend Containers**
- Create Dockerfiles for the **frontend** (Vite with ReactJS) and **backend** (Python Flask application).
- Define services in a `docker-compose.yml` file:
  - **Frontend** service: Expose the ReactJS application on port `3000`.
  - **Backend** service: Expose the Flask API on port `5555` with a shared network for inter-service communication.
  - **Database** service: Use MongoDB with SSL/TLS enabled for secure communication.

### **Docker-Compose Configuration**
- Use environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` for flexibility across environments (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`).
- Define volume mounts for development to enable live code reloading.
- Add health checks for each service to ensure reliability.

### **CI/CD Integration**
- Integrate Docker builds into the CI pipeline to validate Dockerfile correctness and run containerized tests.
- Push Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR) for deployment.

### **Deployment**
- Deploy using Docker-Compose on production servers with `docker compose up`.
- Scale services with `docker compose up --scale <service>=<replicas>` as needed.
