# ADR 003: Selection of Database Technology

## Status
Decided

## Context
Textify requires a reliable, scalable, and efficient database system to store and manage various types of data, including user information, translation histories, OCR results, user preferences, and collaborative project data. After evaluating several database technologies such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MongoDB, the selection was narrowed down based on key factors including:

- **Scalability**
- **Performance**
- **Flexibility and Schema Design**
- **Ease of Integration with Backend Technologies**
- **Developer Productivity and Community Support**
- **Resource Requirements**
- **Cost**
- **Maintainability**
- **Future-Proofing**
- **Ethical and Legal Considerations**

## Decision
Textify will adopt **MongoDB** as the primary database technology.

## Rationale

### **MongoDB**
- **Scalability**: MongoDB offers horizontal scaling through sharding, allowing the system to handle increasing amounts of data and high traffic efficiently.
- **Performance**: Optimized for read and write operations, MongoDB provides high performance suitable for real-time applications like Textify.
- **Flexibility and Schema Design**: As a NoSQL database, MongoDB allows for flexible and dynamic schemas, accommodating the diverse and evolving data structures required by Textify (e.g., varied user preferences, translation models, and collaborative project data).
- **Ease of Integration**: MongoDB integrates seamlessly with Python through libraries like PyMongo and ODMs like MongoEngine, facilitating smooth backend development.
- **Developer Productivity**: The document-oriented nature of MongoDB simplifies data modeling and reduces the complexity associated with relational databases, enhancing developer productivity.
- **Community and Support**: MongoDB has a large and active community, extensive documentation, and numerous third-party tools, ensuring robust support and continuous improvements.
- **Maintainability**: MongoDB’s intuitive query language and rich feature set (e.g., indexing, aggregation) simplify database management and maintenance tasks.
- **Future-Proofing**: MongoDB’s scalability and flexibility make it well-suited to accommodate future enhancements and growing data requirements of Textify.
- **Cost**: MongoDB offers a free tier with sufficient capabilities for development and initial deployment, with scalable paid options as the project grows.

## Alternatives

### **MySQL**
- **Pros**:
  - Mature and widely-used relational database.
  - Strong ACID compliance and transactional support.
  - Extensive tooling and community support.
- **Cons**:
  - Rigid schema design can limit flexibility.
  - Scaling horizontally is more complex compared to NoSQL databases.
  - May require more effort to handle unstructured or semi-structured data.

### **PostgreSQL**
- **Pros**:
  - Advanced features like full-text search, JSON support, and extensibility.
  - Strong ACID compliance and transactional integrity.
  - Robust community and support.
- **Cons**:
  - More complex setup and maintenance compared to NoSQL databases.
  - While it supports JSON, it may not be as flexible as MongoDB for document-oriented data.

### **SQLite**
- **Pros**:
  - Lightweight and easy to set up.
  - Ideal for small-scale applications or development environments.
  - No server setup required.
- **Cons**:
  - Limited scalability and concurrency handling.
  - Not suitable for production environments with high traffic or large datasets.

## Consequences

### **Positive**
- **Flexibility**: MongoDB’s schema-less design allows for easy adaptation to changing data requirements without significant schema migrations.
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling ensures that Textify can grow to accommodate increasing data volumes and user traffic without compromising performance.
- **Developer Efficiency**: Simplified data modeling and integration with Python enhance development speed and reduce complexity.
- **Performance**: Optimized for high read/write throughput, ensuring responsive and real-time interactions within Textify.
- **Community and Ecosystem**: Access to a wealth of resources, tools, and community support facilitates problem-solving and continuous improvement.

### **Negative**
- **Data Consistency**: As a NoSQL database, MongoDB offers eventual consistency in some configurations, which may require careful handling to ensure data integrity in critical operations.
- **Learning Curve**: Team members familiar only with relational databases may need training to effectively utilize MongoDB’s features and best practices.
- **Operational Complexity**: Managing a distributed MongoDB cluster (if scaling horizontally) can introduce operational challenges that require proper tooling and expertise.

## Implementation
- **Database Setup**:
  - Install and configure MongoDB on the chosen hosting platform (e.g., cloud-based services like MongoDB Atlas or on-premises servers).
  - Set up user authentication and secure access controls to protect sensitive data.
  
- **Integration with Backend**:
  - Utilize Python libraries such as PyMongo or ODMs like MongoEngine to interface with MongoDB.
  - Design data models that leverage MongoDB’s document-oriented structure, ensuring efficient data retrieval and storage.
  
- **Data Migration**:
  - Develop scripts or use ETL tools to migrate any existing data from alternative databases to MongoDB, if applicable.
  
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Implement indexing strategies to enhance query performance.
  - Utilize aggregation pipelines for complex data processing tasks.
  
- **Scalability Planning**:
  - Design the database architecture to support sharding and replication for horizontal scaling and high availability.
  
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
  - Set up monitoring tools (e.g., MongoDB Cloud Monitoring, Prometheus) to track database performance and health.
  - Establish regular backup and recovery procedures to safeguard data integrity.
