# ADR 007: Use Coqui-TTS for Text-to-Speech (TTS)

## Status
Decided

## Context
Text-to-Speech (TTS) is a core feature of Textify, enabling the generation of high-quality speech from textual input. Several TTS libraries and APIs were evaluated to determine the most suitable solution for this project. The main requirements for the TTS system include:

1. **Ease of Integration**: Seamless integration with the existing Python-based backend.
2. **Flexibility**: Ability to customize voices, languages, and speech styles.
3. **Performance**: Efficient generation of audio files with low latency.
4. **Quality**: High-quality, natural-sounding speech.
5. **Cost**: Minimizing operational and licensing costs.
6. **Open Source**: Preference for open-source solutions to avoid vendor lock-in.

### Solutions Considered
1. **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API**
2. **Microsoft Azure Speech Service**
3. **Amazon Polly**
4. **pyttsx3**
5. **Coqui-TTS**

## Decision
Coqui-TTS will be used as the primary library for Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality in Textify.

## Rationale

### Why Coqui-TTS?
1. **High-Quality Speech**:
   - Coqui-TTS offers state-of-the-art, natural-sounding voices with support for multiple languages and dialects.
   - It supports advanced TTS models like Tacotron 2, FastSpeech, and FastPitch, providing flexibility in quality and performance.

2. **Ease of Use**:
   - Coqui-TTS integrates easily with Python, aligning with the existing backend architecture of Textify.
   - Its API design simplifies the process of loading models, configuring parameters, and generating speech.

3. **Customizability**:
   - Allows for training and fine-tuning custom voices and models if required in the future.
   - Supports parameters like pitch, speed, and volume for dynamic adjustments.

4. **Open Source**:
   - Coqui-TTS is an open-source project, avoiding vendor lock-in and providing full control over deployment.
   - No per-usage fees, reducing long-term costs.

5. **Community and Ecosystem**:
   - Coqui-TTS has an active community, ongoing development, and extensive documentation, ensuring continued support.

6. **Performance**:
   - Models in Coqui-TTS are optimized for deployment on both CPUs and GPUs, offering flexibility based on hardware availability.
   - Pretrained models reduce the overhead of setting up a high-quality TTS system.

### Alternatives Considered

#### 1. **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API**
- **Pros**:
  - Excellent quality and variety of voices.
  - Simple integration via REST API.
- **Cons**:
  - Expensive for high-volume usage.
  - Dependent on internet connectivity and cloud infrastructure.
- **Reason for Rejection**:
  - High operational costs and reliance on external services.

#### 2. **Microsoft Azure Speech Service**
- **Pros**:
  - High-quality output and extensive features.
  - Integration with Azure's ecosystem.
- **Cons**:
  - Complex setup and usage for custom voices.
  - Licensing costs and dependency on Azure.
- **Reason for Rejection**:
  - Limited flexibility and high cost for scaling.

#### 3. **Amazon Polly**
- **Pros**:
  - Affordable pricing for low-scale usage.
  - Support for multiple languages and styles.
- **Cons**:
  - Average voice quality compared to alternatives.
  - API limitations for dynamic customizations.
- **Reason for Rejection**:
  - Voice quality and customization do not meet project requirements.

#### 4. **pyttsx3**
- **Pros**:
  - Lightweight, offline functionality.
  - Simple Python-based library.
- **Cons**:
  - Limited voice options and poor quality compared to Coqui-TTS.
  - Slower performance for large-scale usage.
- **Reason for Rejection**:
  - Insufficient quality and flexibility.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **High-Quality Speech**: Coqui-TTS ensures natural and expressive speech output.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Avoids usage-based fees, reducing long-term expenses.
- **Customizability**: Supports fine-tuning for specific use cases.
- **Offline Capability**: Can be deployed in isolated or restricted environments without relying on cloud infrastructure.
- **Active Development**: Benefits from improvements and features added by the open-source community.

### Negative
- **Resource Usage**: TTS models require significant computational resources, particularly for GPU acceleration.
- **Initial Setup**: Setting up and optimizing Coqui-TTS for specific use cases requires time and expertise.
- **Model Size**: Some pretrained models can be large, increasing storage and memory requirements.

## Implementation

### Steps
1. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose a pretrained Coqui-TTS model (e.g., `tts_models/en/ljspeech/tacotron2-DDC`).
   - Test multiple models to evaluate trade-offs between quality and performance.

2. **Integration**:
   - Install Coqui-TTS and configure it in the backend.
   - Wrap Coqui-TTS calls in a Python class (`TTSSynthesizer`) for abstraction and reuse.

3. **Optimization**:
   - Optimize model inference for the deployment environment (e.g., use GPU if available).
   - Configure batching or caching for frequently requested texts.

4. **Testing**:
   - Verify the quality and accuracy of generated audio.
   - Conduct load tests to ensure performance under high concurrency.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy Coqui-TTS alongside the backend, ensuring it has access to necessary resources (e.g., GPUs).
   - Monitor resource usage and tune parameters as needed.
