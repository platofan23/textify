# ADR 008: Use Whisper by OpenAI for Speech-to-Text (STT)

## Status  
Decided  

## Context  
Speech-to-Text (STT) is a critical feature of Textify, enabling users to convert spoken language into text accurately. Several STT frameworks and models were evaluated to identify the most suitable solution based on the following requirements:  

1. **Accuracy**: High transcription accuracy, even in noisy environments.  
2. **Multilingual Support**: Ability to transcribe multiple languages.  
3. **Ease of Integration**: Seamless compatibility with Textify’s backend.  
4. **Performance**: Efficient processing speed with low latency.  
5. **Cost**: Minimizing or eliminating usage fees.  
6. **Open Source**: Preference for open-source solutions to avoid vendor lock-in.  

### Solutions Considered  
1. **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API**  
2. **Microsoft Azure Speech Service**  
3. **Amazon Transcribe**  
4. **Coqui STT**  
5. **Whisper by OpenAI**
